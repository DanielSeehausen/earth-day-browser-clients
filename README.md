 # Contributing

- See the associated github project board or ask in slack field-yay-engineering channel if you aren't sure what to work on
- Project board works as follows:
  1. new issues will automatically create cards in the `To do` column. Try to make sure your card is associated with an issue
  2. if you select a card to work on, **make a branch** and edit the card with your github username. Then, move it to the `In progress` column manually. Please create and name a branch in relation to the card.
  3. once finished, submit a PR for `master <-- <your-branch>` and request **at least one reviewer!**. This will automatically move your card to the `PR ready` column. Merging into `master` requires one accepted pr review.
  4. **IMPORTANT** once approved, please merge or rebase with master on `<your-branch>`, then squash & merge your branch into `master`! If you aren't familiar with rebasing, please ask anyone else for some pairing on this - it is dank and keeps the git history clean and keeps us from goofing up with asynchronous work on the projects.
